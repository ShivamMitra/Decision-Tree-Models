## Overview
This repository aims to teach core concepts behind decision tree algorithms through hands-on examples. It covers model construction, visualization, evaluation, and practical applications on real or synthetic datasets. Ideal for students, educators, or data science enthusiasts exploring tree-based learning.

## Notebooks / Files Included
Here’s a breakdown of what you might find:

1. **Classification_Tree.ipynb**  
   Build and visualize decision tree classifiers (e.g., using scikit-learn’s `DecisionTreeClassifier`), covering metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

2. **Regression_Tree.ipynb**  
   Explore decision tree regression (`DecisionTreeRegressor`), with demonstrations on continuous target prediction and evaluation metrics like MAE/MSE.

3. **Ensemble_Methods.ipynb** *(if present)*  
   Introduces tree-based ensemble methods such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, comparing their performance against single trees.

4. **Custom_Tree_Implementation.ipynb** *(if present)*  
   Hand-coded version of decision tree logic—computing entropy/information gain, splitting, recursive tree building—to deepen algorithmic understanding.

5. **Datasets/** *(optional directory)*  
   Contains datasets used for modeling (e.g., `iris.csv`, `housing.csv`).

6. **requirements.txt** *(if present)*  
   Lists dependencies like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivamMitra/Decision-Tree-Models.git
   cd Decision-Tree-Models
2. Install dependencies
If requirements.txt exists:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Otherwise, manually install:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib notebook
```
Launch Jupyter Notebook
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
```
Then open any desired notebook (e.g., 1_Classification_Tree.ipynb) and execute cells to follow along.

## Usage Examples
- Classification Demo: Train a tree on the Iris or Titanic dataset, visualize the tree, and evaluate classification performance.

- Regression Demo: Fit a regression tree to predict housing prices or similar continuous outcomes, and assess metrics like RMSE.

- Custom Implementation: Experiment with your own decision tree logic to compute splits using information gain or entropy—ideal for educational purposes.

## Contributing
- Contributions are welcome! Potential improvements include:
- Adding notebooks for advanced topics (e.g., pruning, cost-complexity)
- Including alternative libraries like XGBoost or LightGBM
- Enhancing documentation with diagrams, explanations, or interactive widgets
